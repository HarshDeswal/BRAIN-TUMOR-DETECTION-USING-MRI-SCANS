# Detection of Brain tumor from MRI scans 

In this project we are predicting the presence of brain tumor from MRI scan using ResNet50 architecture.
We are also showing the confidence score of the prediction for more reliability along with highlighting the tumor area using the Watershed algorithm.

#Resnet Model
ResNet50:
It is a deep learning model used for computer vision applications. It is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture designed to support hundreds or thousands of convolutional layers.
